# Mandelbrot
This Java program generates the Mandelbrot Set, a visually captivating fractal image. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

Initialization: The program sets up parameters such as image width, height, and maximum iterations.

Image Generation: It creates an image buffer and iterates through each pixel.

Mandelbrot Set Calculation: For each pixel, it applies the Mandelbrot iteration formula to determine if the complex number associated with the pixel belongs to the Mandelbrot Set.

Coloring: Based on the number of iterations needed to escape a predefined threshold, the program assigns colors to pixels.

Output: Finally, it outputs the generated Mandelbrot Set image.
